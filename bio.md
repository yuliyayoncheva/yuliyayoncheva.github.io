# Bio

Yuliya Yoncheva, PhD is a neuroscientist and researcher at [NYU Grossman School of Medicine](https://med.nyu.edu/faculty/yuliya-n-yoncheva), where she investigates the changing nature of expertise in the age of AI. Her current work focuses on clinical apprenticeship as a proxy for scientific practice, examining how automated feedback systems influence the transmission of tacit knowledge, empathy, and professional judgment.

Blending backgrounds in neuroscience, decision science, and education, Yuliya explores the "epistemic bootstrapping" problems that arise when novices learn from opaque algorithms. She leads the [AI Communication Compass](https://med.nyu.edu/departments-institutes/innovations-medical-education/research-scholarship/grants/ai-enhanced-feedback-system) project (funded by the [Josiah Macy Jr. Foundation](https://macyfoundation.org/our-grantees/ai-in-med-ed)) and co-founded the [POD Network’s AI in Education SIG](https://podnetwork.org/governance/sigs/), building interdisciplinary communities to navigate the shift from human-to-human to AI-mediated training.
